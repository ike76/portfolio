**HOMECOMP** is a tool to help house-hunters manage their _short list_ of properties, in order to make a better decision.

You can sort by the usual attributes like **price**, **size**, or **bedrooms**. You can also create your own custom attributes to sort by **distance to work**, or even difficult-to-quantify attributes like **kitchen quality**. (add photos and sort by your own ratings)
