**TRIPSYNC** is a tool to help a travel organizer keep track of _people_, _destinations_, and _transit methods_. (flights, taxis, busses, etc)

When a group of people are traveling together, there are often smaller sub-groups or individuals who change a part of the plan. (Jeff and Amber stay at a _different_ hotel, then meet the group for the _same_ flight the next morning, etc)

Even when plans change en route, TRIPSYNC allows you to keep everyone's schedules connected and organized.
